# Analysis-of-Stack-Overflow-Q-A

I used a kaggle dataset about the topic StackSample: 10% of Stack Overflow Q&A. The link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample

This dataset includes questions, answers and tags as text of 10% of questions and answers from the Stack Overflow. I would like to do data exploration over these datasets and study tf-idf. I would like to work on an appropriate machine learning algorithm for these dataset lastly. 

I have done an introductory data explorations until now using Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach by Julia Silge and David Robinson book as a reference.
